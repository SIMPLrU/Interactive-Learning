In this section, you'll learn how to configure Kong plugins. One of the core principles of Kong is its extensibility through plugins. Plugins allow you to easily add new features to your API or make your API easier to manage.

In the steps below you will configure the key-auth plugin to add authentication to your Service. Prior to the addition of this plugin, all requests to your Service would be proxied upstream. Once you add and configure this plugin, only requests with the correct API key(s) will be proxied - all other requests will be rejected by Kong, thus protecting your upstream service from unauthorized use.
